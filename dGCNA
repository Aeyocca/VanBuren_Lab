Welp I just lost the notes for the last few days because I didn't save the file and closed it.. lesson learned
Not too big of a deal, I can recreate the error message from yesterday its not necessary, just shows that I need to update the compiler from version 6 to version 7.. but thats a big problem I guess, maybe should email someone from hpcc as last resort, tried just downloading java software but that isn't working, maybe can install for cygwin environment.. we shall see

Try to summarize notes that were lost because they were not saved:
java is complicated
All the .java files seem to be part of a package called networkCalcPackage as they all have that as the first line. It seems Operations.java is the only one that doesn't depend on other scripts so far, but if I find out it does, will have another problem.
I have all the .java scripts on hpcc
I uploaded all other required packages and pointed to them using:
$ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:${package .jar file}


Sweet. List of exports needed:
[yoccaala@dev-intel14 01_VanBuren]$ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:.
[yoccaala@dev-intel14 01_VanBuren]$ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:commons-lang3-3.6.jar
[yoccaala@dev-intel14 01_VanBuren]$ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:commons-math3-3.6.1.jar
[yoccaala@dev-intel14 01_VanBuren]$ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:commons-cli-1.4.jar
[yoccaala@dev-intel14 01_VanBuren]$ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:jcommon-1.0.23.jar
[yoccaala@dev-intel14 01_VanBuren]$ export CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:jfreechart-1.0.19.jar

Now we got some jar files that are all dependent on each other. Lets try

$ javac *.java
I think it worked, got all .class files, but also got OperationsS1 and S2 .class. Not sure what this is. Additionally got the following error: has additional uses or overrides of a deprecated API
Looked it up, said I'm just using outdated things which Seems like program could still run so I'm going to roll with it

$ java NetworkCalculator determine -d Sedum_RNAseq_TPM-v3.0.1-average.txt -c pcc -aL 2 -aH 8 -mL 0.1 -mH 0.9
 Could not find or load main class NetworkCalculator

Its looking better, moved all .java and .class files to directory, directly above that directory I got all the package .jar files,
$ java networkCalcPackage.NetworkCalculator -determine
usage: java -jar jarfile.jar
 -compare <compare>         compare several network matricies
 -construct <construct>     construct a network via application of a
                            topological overlap calculation
 -determine <determine>     Determine best parameters for dataset

 -permute <permute>         perform background permutations to determine

                            to scale free criteria
 -similarity <similarity>   construct a similarity matrix and print it to

$ java networkCalcPackage.NetworkCalculator determine -d ../../Sedum_RNAseq_TPM-v3.0.1-average.txt -c pcc -aL 2 -aH 8 -mL 0.1 -mH 0.9 -t 1
data file is not a rectilinear data file

Check Sedum file

Boooo, I'm getting it to run o shit!!!! I think I can just remove second gene column, hold up though, going to let it run and see what happens, not sure how we will get to specify which series of treatments to look at
Seems like optimum input file format is gene names in first column and treatments in all the rest

Killed the job, would take forever running on command line to try all combos to determine parameters, Submit bash shell for that, 4:00:00 walltime to start, 6 Gb mem walltime=4:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=3,feature='intel14|intel16',mem=6gb
Just submit as is, may have memory problems but we will get there when we get there

$ qsub qsub_network_determine
48664920.mgr-04.i
48665103.mgr-04.i

request 50 Gb mem

What kind of output is this? How will this tell me my optimum parameters?

fuck it, run with alpha = 20, mu = 0.8

walltime exceeded (had requested 4 hours)

Alrighty, new information:
Need to have two separate data frames, one for each treatment (C3 and CAM), run determine on both (run script twice), run construct on both (run script twice i think check help options again), run compare together, for the compare command, I believe you just point to the directory that contains the output from construct. That would make sense but not specified in help options
Split the dataframes first:

module load powertools
dev 
# random dev. node for testing (< 4 hrs)

haha, just like ssh to dev node, he mentioned you can request a certain number of cores or something, I don't remember how, check out hpcc wiki
